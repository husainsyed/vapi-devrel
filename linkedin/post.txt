This VAPI voice agent replaces customer support calls for car rental agencies. Meet Elizabeth, the AI agent.

What Elizabeth does every call:
1️⃣ Verifies your rental agreement
2️⃣ Looks up the reservation
3️⃣ Tells you how much it'd cost you if you extended your rental

Why it actually works:
🟦 Extremely low latency (instant replies, zero lag)
🟦 Understands all about the rental agreements (start date, end date, costs, etc)
🟦 Sounds just like a human and doesn't make you wait on the line
🟦 Rich documentation and logging on Vapi's dashboard
🟦 Free to try (no credit card required)

I’m sharing:
 → Step-by-step tutorial
 → Video tutorial
 → My Python code

The best part, didn't take me more than 2 hours to code and deploy.
